## Hardware part
### I have used all those wiring diagrams I have already done and you can find the wiring diagram inside the hardware folder. Therefore, we have changed how the functions should work and how we should use them to work as we want. We used the following system components for this project: 
### Microchip (Atmel) SAM3X8E â€“ ARM embedded computer platform (Arduino due)  

 #### Keypad (Port I/O)  

 #### Photosensor (A/D)  

 #### Temperature sensor (time)  

#### RC servo motor (PWM)  

 #### Switch (HW-int)  

 #### Display (port I/O)  

 #### LED  

#### 2 Push Buttons
