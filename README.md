# GreenHouse-Project
## Software part
### The first implementation is a fully functional date and time display on the screen in the dd/mm/yyyy form (I'm using the keypad as input for typing the date and using a 24-hour clock system).

### The following implementation is recording the temperature over 7 days and then taking the maximum, minimum, and average and displaying it on the screen. The temperatures and the averages for these temperatures were saved in a linked list. 

### Lastly, both the date and time as well as the maximum, minimum, and average temperature were displayed all together on the display simultaneously. Thereafter, in order to make the light sensors point to where the sun is, I put the light sensors on the "servo" and they point towards the sun. However, I also keep count of how many hours the plants get light and darkness.


## Hardware part
### I have used all those wiring diagrams I have already done and you can find the wiring diagram inside the hardware folder. I used the following system components for this project: 

### Microchip (Atmel) SAM3X8E â€“ ARM embedded computer platform (Arduino due)  

 #### Keypad (Port I/O)  

 #### Photosensor (A/D)  

 #### Temperature sensor (time)  

#### RC servo motor (PWM)  

 #### Switch (HW-int)  

 #### Display (port I/O)  

 #### LED  

#### 2 Push Buttons
