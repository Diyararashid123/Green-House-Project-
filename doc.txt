# Hardware part These are hardware drivers that was usen in the project:  

### at91sam3x8.h 

### system_sam3x.h 

## This is all we have used, and we have made all the connections according to lab 2 and 3 wiring diagrams on Blackboard. 

## Next, we have programmed the keypad in such a way that it will be equal to -1, meaning if we do not press the keypad the program understands it and does not go any further and it will wait for a signal to reset, for example when you press the keypad, then when you have pressed a number that is more than -1 it will print out that number on the screen.

## Sofware part 
### The software library's we used are: 

### <string.h> (To use strings) 

 ### <stdio.h>(Many useful functions, for example printf() ) 

 ### <time.h>(Useful when working with time) 

## We have a limit where the difference between the two light sensors values is big enough to make it necessary to move the servo. We have decided through testing that the value is +- 0.1 which gives us a stable but responsive functionality.
